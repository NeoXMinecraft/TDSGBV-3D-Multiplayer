# TDSGBV-3D-Multiplayer
TDSGBV (Tower Defense Survival Game By Vadik1) 3D - is a 3D multiplayer survival game, where your goal is to collect resources, build a base and survive for as many in-game days as you can.


▶▶ Modified Description for this project.

▶ DESCRIPTION:
TDSGBV 3D - is a 3D multiplayer survival game, where your goal is to collect resources, build a base and survive for as many in-game days as you can. At night you will be attacked by different types of enemies. Each night their amount and variety increases. You can only respawn, if you craft and place a bed, but be careful, because enemies will try to destroy it too. To help you protect it there are turrets and other traps which you can make and place.

▶ HISTORY:
I made this project because of popularity of my "Raft 3D" project created in 2017. I tried to make this game better in every aspect compared to it.
First ideas to make this game appeared in 2017. I made a prototype(v0.0) (181441255 broken), but soon realised that my old 3D engine is not suitable for this type of game.
I started working on TDSGBV(v1.0) (251320123) on a new engine in September 2018. It was generally similar to v2.0, but extremely glitchy and code was a mess. Then I completely remade it(v2.0) starting from summer 2020 with a lot of new features.
